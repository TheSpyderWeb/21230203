# PROJECTS

This repository contains various small projects and coding exercises, showcasing my practice in different programming languages, frameworks, and concepts. Each folder or file focuses on a specific topic, ranging from language basics to more complex algorithms and problem-solving exercises. The goal of this repository is to document my learning progress, try out new techniques, and refine my skills across diverse areas in software development.

Contents

Languages: Includes examples and exercises in languages like C++, C#, HTML, CSS, and Java.
Concepts: Covers fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditional statements, functions, and data structures.
Algorithms: Practice files for common algorithms, including sorting, searching, and basic data manipulation.
Mini Projects: Small, standalone projects designed to apply multiple skills in one place.
Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback! This repository serves as a work-in-progress portfolio as I continue learning and expanding my skill set.
